# time-converter

This Python script converts entered seconds into minutes and hours, displaying the result in the hh:mm:ss format.
If you provide an invalid input, the script prompts you to try again.

It is my first working script that I have written. I wrote it to practice :)

How to use:
- Simply open the file with Python. The script will guide you through the process.
